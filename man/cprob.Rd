\usage{
cprob(y, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A binary outcome vector (0/1 or logical). Must be the same length as
`x`.}

\item{x}{A binary predictor vector (0/1 or logical). Must be the same length
as `y`.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the conditional probability that `y = 1`
given `x = 1`.
}
\description{
Computes the conditional probability \eqn{P(Y=1 \mid X=1)} for
two binary vectors `y` and `x`. Rows with missing values in either vector are
excluded.
}
\examples{
cprob(misimdata$y,misimdata$x1)
}
