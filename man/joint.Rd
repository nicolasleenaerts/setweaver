\usage{
joint(y, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A binary outcome vector (0/1 or logical). Must be the same length as `x`.}

\item{x}{A binary predictor vector (0/1 or logical). Must be the same length as `y`.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the joint probability that both `x = 1` and `y = 1`,
calculated as the joint count divided by the number of complete cases.
}
\description{
Computes the joint probability \eqn{P(X = 1, Y = 1)} for two binary vectors
`x` and `y`. Rows with missing values in either vector are excluded.
}
\examples{
joint(misimdata$y,misimdata$x1)
}
