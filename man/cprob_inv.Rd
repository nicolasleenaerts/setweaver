\usage{
cprob_inv(y, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A binary outcome vector (0/1 or logical). Must be the same length as
`x`.}

\item{x}{A binary predictor vector (0/1 or logical). Must be the same length
as `y`.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the conditional probability that `y = 1`
given `x = 0`.
}
\description{
Computes the conditional probability \eqn{P(Y = 1 \mid X = 0)}
for two binary vectors `y` and `x`. Rows with missing values in either vector
are excluded.
}
\examples{
cprob_inv(misimdata$y,misimdata$x1)
}
