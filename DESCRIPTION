Description: Create sets of variables based on a mutual
    information approach. In this context, a set is a collection of
    distinct elements (e.g., variables) that can also be treated as a
    single entity.  Mutual information, a concept from probability theory,
    quantifies the dependence between two variables by expressing how much
    information about one variable can be gained from observing the other.
    Furthermore, you can analyze, and visualize
    these sets in order to better understand the relationships among
    variables.
